# Bird and Drone Detection & Tracking from UAV Camera

# Objective
Develop a computer vision and deep learning model capable of detecting and tracking birds and drones from an onboard camera installed on a UAV. The model should effectively differentiate between birds and drones, even when they appear as small objects in the image (low pixel count). The focus is on building an efficient, explainable, and deployable solution suitable for resource-constrained environments.
